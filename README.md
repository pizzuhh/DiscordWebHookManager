# DiscordWebHookManager
Simple webhook manager written in C using libcurl

# Features:

Can see guild id, channel id, user who created the webhook

you can delete the webhook, send message or load json file(for more complex messages like embeds)

# How to use?

If you are on linux you are in luck since the application is compiled on linux :) you can jsut download the executable and run it "./DiscordWebhookManager"

If you are on windows, well i still haven't compiled it for windows, tho you can compile it yourself since it's open-source just don't forget libcurl :P

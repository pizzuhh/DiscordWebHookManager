# DiscordWebHookManager
Simple webhook manager written in C using libcurl and cJSON

# Features

Can see guild id, channel id, user who created the webhook.

You can delete the webhook, send message or load json file(for more complex messages like embeds).

You can make "load" file and put **ONLY** the webhook URL and it'll load it automatically everytime you run it.

# How to use?

If you are on linux you are in luck since the application is compiled on linux :) you can jsut download the executable and run it "./DiscordWebhookManager".

If you are on windows, well i still haven't compiled it for windows, tho you can compile it yourself since it's open-source just don't forget libcurl :P.
